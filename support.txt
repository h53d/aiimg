Purpose:
AI CutoutCraft is a smart image editing tool powered entirely by on-device AI. No registration, no uploads, no internet required. Just tap a few times, and you’re done — cut out backgrounds, build layouts, and export your results. Everything works offline, locally, and privately.

 - Intuitive Editing Tools: Use simple gestures to move, resize, and rotate each cutout. Interactions are optimized separately for macOS and iOS to feel right at home on every device.
